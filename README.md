# Random
A small tool for randomly selecting a student within a specified collection without allowing repetition.
Originally intended for @mjmuir to use in class when choosing which student to present their answers, as to not randomly select the same student twice.

Available at http://aryuko.github.io/random/

Here's an example of how it looks in action:

## How to use:
Begin by inserting the **github handles** of all 13 total students through the input field. Left click to check/uncheck the checkboxes to mark whether the students are present or not. Right click to remove a handle. Increment the week number by left clicking the counter, decrement it by right clicking it.

After you've clicked "Select a student", the output will be shown to the right of the button with a link to that student's repo for the current week.

Students already selected are added to the left list, and cannot be selected again. Left click these to remove them from that list.

Handles and week number is stored in a cookie, no need to reenter the information every Ã¶vning, all you need to do is check which students are present!
